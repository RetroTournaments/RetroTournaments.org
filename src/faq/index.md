<h3> How does the combined view in the Simultaneous Time Attack tournaments work? </h3>

Basically we wire a custom logic analyzer directly to the console and extract all the information we need for a custom computer program to put it all together.
That's <a href="/argos/">Argos!</a>

<h3> Can I use an emulator? </h3>

Emulation is not only an integral part of our development process, it is fundamental to the furtherance of retro-gaming and to preserving games and hardware which have been abandoned by their original manufacturers.
Currently we have been focusing on using original hardware in our competitions only because we haven't had time to develop both!
In the future some tournaments may support competitors playing on emulators.
