# Support

Thank you for considering supporting the project!
There are a few things you can do.


### Share
Share the videos with your friends, colleagues, and enemies.
If we can reach a wider audience there's a better chance that someone will want to fund the project so that we can all be speedrunning on professional video monitors with big prize money and flashy video production stuff going on ;).

### Become a YouTube member
Join as a YouTube member to provide recurring financial support. 
This is the best way to provide the necessary funds to support the project, and is hugely appreciated.
You'll also find a sprite labeled with your username in future vignettes like the one at the bottom of the page!

### Donate your old hardware
I will always accept mostly-working consoles for any of our events. Currently Nintendo Entertainment Systems!
Additionally, reasonable quality CRTs are always in high demand, just get in [touch](/contact)!

### Get in touch by email
For one time contributions, sponsorships, etc. just head over the the [contact](/contact/) page and shoot me an email.
We can chat!

All monetary contributions are used only for furthering the project, for example by purchasing equipment, ordering PCBs, paying server costs, and more.
A long-term goal is for the CRGA to become a nonprofit organization devoted to advancing retro speedrunning tournaments and events worldwide.
You can be a part of that.
