# Who we are

RetroTournaments.org is the home of two initiatives:
the **Competitive Retro Gaming Association** is devoted to organizing, governing, and documenting the greatest retro speedrunning competitions in the world,
and [Argos](/argos/) is the open-source technology stack which supports those competitions and other [simultaneous time attack tournaments](/sta/).
We are a group of speedrunners, and speedrunning enthusiasts, who are working to celebrate retro gaming, friendly competition, and the joy that comes from achieving your goals.

The CRGA and Argos are both entirely ran by volunteers, we rely on your [support](/support/) in order to develop these competitions and expand around the globe.
Our competitions provide incredible experiences and opportunities for our competitors while simultaneously working to preserve retro technologies for future generations.
We are very early in this process, but with your support we hope to get there sooner rather than later.
Thank you for joining us for this fun and wild ride!

# Organization

We're just getting started here, so the CRGA is ran by two dedicated volunteers and a small community on [discord](/community/).
Matthew Deutsch (the one currently writing this) is an engineer with experience in mathematical optimization and mining engineering.
What is speedrunning except for an applied optimization problem?
A natural fit.

Anthony is a videographer with a broad skillset encompassing all of the filming, editing, and mastering of the produced content.
Both Anthony and Matthew have a strong connection to and affinity for retro gaming and competition.
It's a lot nicer when you can sit down and play a game without downloading a 10GB update.
These older games still have a tremendous amount to offer.

# What's next for us?

Honestly we're still trying to find our audience and create a sustainable platform!
The feedback from competitors and those who have been able to attend events is incredible, but that good feedback is not enough to sustain future events.
With the help from our growing community we hope to expand to additional speedrunning events and create more exciting opportunities.
