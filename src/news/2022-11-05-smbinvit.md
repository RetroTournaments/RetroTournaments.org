The **2022 Super Mario Bros. Invitational** at Level 7 Games in Colorado was a huge success - both the [Any%](/tournaments/SMBIN2022ANYPE.html) and [Warpless](/tournaments/SMBIN2022WARPL.html) tournaments were great.
thank you so much to all of the amazing [competitors](/persons), volunteers, and to everyone that was able to attend.
I am looking forward to all of the tournaments to come!
