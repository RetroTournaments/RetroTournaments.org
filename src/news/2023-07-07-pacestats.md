PACE Summer 2023 was an incredible event, with 16 [competitors](/persons) in attendance (5 returning, 11 new).
We held three [tournaments](/tournaments), and two live time attack events in Super Mario Bros. Any% and Warpless.
An extra huge thanks is owed to all of the runners, the commentators, volunteers, and to the entire [GSA](https://twitch.tv/speedrun) team.
Thank you!
