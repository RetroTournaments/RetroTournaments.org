# A good idea would be to have script that looks at the comment threads on youtube and finds super thanks.
# This is close:
#  https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/commentThreads/list
# however after a ton of searching through the api and google etc I eventually found this:
#  https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/347509732
# bruh.

# Now I suppose I have to go to the youtube studio and continue to enter things manually.
# Or do I? see 'parse_superthanks.py'
